          >"Armored Core is a 1997 third-person shooter mech video game
          developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation. The game is the first
          entry in the Armored Core series. The story introduces many elements
          that are commonly found in later game in the series, such as
          corporatocracies and mech robots known as "Armored Cores". The game
          takes place in a future Earth that has been wiped out by a cataclysm
          and forced humanity underground, a theme which would continue until
          Armored Core 4. Gameplay involves controlling Armored Cores in combat
          scenarios against other Cores and vehicles. Cores are highly modular,
          allowing players a great deal of customization over them, such as
          swapping out different leg units to gain speed advantages. As players
          complete more missions, they gain credits to purchase different items
          and parts for their Core."
